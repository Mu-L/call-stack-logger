# Call Stack Logger #

Call Stack Logger uses function instrumentation to facilitate logging of
every function call. Each nesting adds an ident, whereas returning from a
function removes it. As the result call stack tree is produced at the runtime
giving knowledge of the actual program's flow of execution.
