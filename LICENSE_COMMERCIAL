# Commercial License

This is a placeholder for Commercial or Closed-source license. If you want to use
Call Stack Logger for a commercial product or a closed-source project, you will typically
need to purchase commercial license. To do so please contact me via email at t.augustyn@poczta.fm
in order to discuss requirements and formulate a license that best suits your needs.

If you purchase a commercial or closed-source license for Call Stack Logger, you must comply with
the terms and conditions listed in the associated license agreement; the GNU AGPLv3 terms and
conditions do not apply. The Call Stack Logger software itself remains the same: the only difference
between an open-source Call Stack Logger and a commercial Call Stack Logger are the license terms.
