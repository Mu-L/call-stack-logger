# Call Stack Logger Contributor Agreement

This Call Stack Logger Contributor Agreement ("CSLCA") applies to any contribution that you make
to any product or project managed by us (the “project”), and sets out the intellectual
property rights you assign to us or grant to us in the contributed materials. The terms “us”
and “Call Stack Logger” shall mean the owner of this repository (Tomasz Augustyn). The term “you”
shall mean the person making contribution. By making contribution you agree to be bound by these
CSLCA terms. Read this agreement carefully before contributing. These terms and conditions 
constitute a binding legal agreement. <br/> <br/>

1. The term “contribution” means any source code, patch, sample, graphic, specification, 
   manual, documentation, or any other material posted or submitted by you to the project.
   <br/> <br/> 

2. With respect to any worldwide copyrights, or copyright applications and registrations:
    - you hereby assign to us exclusive ownership of your contribution;
    - you agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your contribution against us, our
      licensees or transferees; and
    - you agree that we may register a copyright in your contribution and exercise all ownership
      rights associated with it. <br/> <br/>

3. With respect to any patents you own, or that you can license without payment to any third party,
   you hereby grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge,
   royalty-free license to:
    - make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contribution in
      whole or in part, alone or in combination with or included in any product, work or materials
      arising out of the project to which your contribution was submitted, and
    - at our option, to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of
      sublicensees or other licensing arrangements. <br/> <br/>

4. The rights that you grant to us under these terms are effective on the date you first submitted a
   contribution to us, even if your submission took place before the date you read and accepted
   these terms. <br/> <br/>

5. You covenant, represent, warrant and agree that:
    - each contribution that you submit is and shall be an original work of authorship and you can
      legally grant the rights set out in this CSLCA; and
    - to the best of your knowledge, each contribution will not violate any third party's
      copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights. <br/> <br/>

    You agree to notify us if you become aware of any circumstance which would make any of the
    foregoing representations inaccurate in any respect. Call Stack Logger may publicly disclose your
    participation in the project, including the fact that you have read and accepted the CSLCA.
    <br/> <br/>

6. Call Stack Logger licenses your contribution under the same terms and conditions as your
   license(s) for the project at the time you submitted your contribution to the project.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Call Stack Logger will not indemnify you in the event your
   contribution violates any third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual
   property rights. <br/> <br/>

7. This CSLCA is governed by the laws of Poland. Any choice of law rules will not apply. <br/> <br/>

8. I am accepting CSLCA on behalf of myself as an individual and no other person or entity,
   including my employer, has or will have rights with respect to my contributions. <br/> <br/>
